Sure, we can rename the `Quizzes` table to `Examinations` and update the references accordingly. Here's the revised schema design:

### Tables and Relationships

1. **Users Table**:
   - Stores information about the users who take the quizzes (now called examinations).

2. **Examinations Table**:
   - Stores metadata about each examination.

3. **Questions Table**:
   - Stores the questions for each examination.

4. **Answers Table**:
   - Stores the possible answers for each question.

5. **User_Exam_Attempts Table**:
   - Tracks user attempts on examinations.

6. **User_Responses Table**:
   - Stores the responses of users for each question in an examination attempt.

7. **Figures Table** (Optional):
   - Stores figures associated with questions.

### Revised Schema Design

#### 1. Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Examinations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Examinations (
    examination_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3. Questions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Questions (
    question_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    examination_id INT REFERENCES Examinations(examination_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    figure_id INT REFERENCES Figures(figure_id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- Optional if figures are used
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 4. Answers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Answers (
    answer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    question_id INT REFERENCES Questions(question_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    answer_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 5. User_Exam_Attempts Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE User_Exam_Attempts (
    attempt_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    examination_id INT REFERENCES Examinations(examination_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 6. User_Responses Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE User_Responses (
    response_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    attempt_id INT REFERENCES User_Exam_Attempts(attempt_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question_id INT REFERENCES Questions(question_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    answer_id INT REFERENCES Answers(answer_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    responded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 7. Figures Table (Optional)
```sql
CREATE TABLE Figures (
    figure_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    figure_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);
```

### Relationships and Integrity
- **Users**: Each user can have multiple examination attempts.
- **Examinations**: Each examination can have multiple questions.
- **Questions**: Each question can have multiple answers and optionally a figure.
- **Answers**: Each answer is linked to a question and indicates whether it is correct.
- **User_Exam_Attempts**: Tracks each user's attempt on an examination.
- **User_Responses**: Records the user's response to each question in an attempt.
- **Figures** (Optional): Stores figures which can be associated with questions.

### Additional Considerations
1. **Indexes**: Create indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields for performance optimization.
2. **Constraints**: Add constraints such as `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
3. **Timestamps**: Use timestamps to track creation and update times for audit purposes.

### Example Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_questions_examination_id ON Questions(examination_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_answers_question_id ON Answers(question_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_exam_attempts_user_id ON User_Exam_Attempts(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_responses_attempt_id ON User_Responses(attempt_id);
```

This revised schema design reflects the change from quizzes to examinations, maintaining the structure and relationships needed for efficient data management and retrieval in your interactive quiz website.
